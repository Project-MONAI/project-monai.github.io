# Brain Tumor Segmentation Model

A state-of-the-art transformer-based model for segmenting brain tumors in MRI images.

## Model Details

This model was developed to accurately segment brain tumors from multi-sequence MRI scans. It can identify and differentiate between various tumor regions, including:

- Whole tumor region
- Tumor core
- Enhancing tumor

## Implementation

The model is implemented using the Transformers library and can be used as follows:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForImageSegmentation
import torch
import nibabel as nib
import numpy as np

# Load the model
model = AutoModelForImageSegmentation.from_pretrained("monai/brain-tumor-segmentation")

# Load and preprocess your MRI data
# This is a simplified example - actual preprocessing may be more complex
def preprocess_mri(nifti_path):
    # Load NIfTI file
    img = nib.load(nifti_path)
    data = img.get_fdata()
    
    # Normalize and prepare for the model
    data = (data - data.mean()) / data.std()
    data = torch.from_numpy(data).float().unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0)
    return data, img.affine

# Example usage
input_data, affine = preprocess_mri("patient_t1.nii.gz")

# Run inference
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(input_data)

# Get segmentation mask
segmentation = outputs.logits.argmax(dim=1).squeeze().numpy()

# Save the result
seg_img = nib.Nifti1Image(segmentation, affine)
nib.save(seg_img, "tumor_segmentation.nii.gz")
```

## Performance

This model has been validated on the BraTS 2021 dataset and achieves the following performance metrics:

| Region | Dice Score | Hausdorff95 |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Whole Tumor | 0.91 | 5.2 mm |
| Tumor Core | 0.88 | 6.7 mm |
| Enhancing Tumor | 0.83 | 8.1 mm |

## Clinical Applications

This model has potential applications in:

- Pre-surgical planning
- Tumor volume monitoring
- Treatment response assessment
- Research studies

## Limitations

- Performance may vary across different MRI scanners and protocols
- The model requires high-quality MRI inputs with standard preprocessing
- Not FDA approved for clinical decision-making without proper validation
