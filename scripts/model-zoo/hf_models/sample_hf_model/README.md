# Sample HF Medical Segmentation Model

This is a sample Hugging Face medical image segmentation model for demonstration purposes.

## Model Overview

This model is designed for segmentation of anatomical structures in medical images. It uses a transformer-based architecture and was trained on a diverse dataset of medical images.

## Usage

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForImageSegmentation
import torch

# Load the model
model = AutoModelForImageSegmentation.from_pretrained("monai/sample-medical-model")

# Prepare your input (example)
input_image = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)

# Run inference
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(input_image)

# Process the segmentation mask
segmentation = outputs.logits.argmax(dim=1)
```

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Dice Score | 0.92 |
| Jaccard Index | 0.85 |
| Hausdorff Distance (95%) | 4.3 mm |

## Limitations

- This model works best on high-quality images with standard orientation
- Performance may degrade on out-of-distribution data
- Not intended for clinical use without proper validation
