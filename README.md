   cd project-monai.github.io
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

## Project Structure

```
project-monai.github.io/
├── components/          # Reusable HTML components
├── assets/             # Static assets (images, CSS, JS)
├── scripts/           # Build and optimization scripts
├── src/               # Source files
└── dist/              # Production build output
```

## Components

The website uses a component-based architecture. Common elements like headers, footers, and navigation are stored in the `components/` directory and included in pages using the include syntax:

```html
<!-- #include file="components/head.html" -->
<!-- #include file="components/header.html" -->
<!-- #include file="components/footer.html" -->
<!-- #include file="components/scripts.html" -->
```

## Development

### Adding New Pages

1. Create a new HTML file in the root directory
2. Use the component includes for common elements
3. Add your page-specific content
4. Update meta tags using the head component variables:
   ```html
   <script>
       document.head.innerHTML = document.head.innerHTML
           .replace('${title}', 'Your Page Title')
           .replace('${description}', 'Your page description')
           .replace('${canonical_url}', 'https://monai.io/your-page.html');
   </script>
   ```

### Modifying Components

Components are located in the `components/` directory. When modifying a component:
1. The change will automatically affect all pages using that component
2. Test the changes across multiple pages to ensure consistency
3. Run the development server to see changes in real-time

### CSS Development

The project uses Tailwind CSS with a custom configuration:

1. Development:
   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```
   This will watch for changes and rebuild the CSS automatically.

2. Adding new styles:
   - Add custom styles in `src/css/`
   - Configure Tailwind in `tailwind.config.js`
   - Custom classes can be added to `assets/css/`

## Building for Production

1. Build the site:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

This will:
- Process and include all components
- Optimize images and assets
- Minify CSS and JavaScript
- Generate the production build in `dist/`

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.
